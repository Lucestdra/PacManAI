# PacManAI
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to play the classic arcade game Ms. Pac-Man using PyTorch and OpenAI's Gymnasium environment. The agent is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to approximate the Q-function, which is used to determine the best actions to take in the game environment.
